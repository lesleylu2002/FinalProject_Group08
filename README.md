# Project Group 08

The project investigates on trends to back up why Uber and taxis in New York have clashed for years. The investigation uses hired-ride trip data from Uber and NYC Yellow cab from January 2020 through August 2024, joining with local historical weather data.

The data used in the project are: "taxi_data", "uber_data", "weather_data", "taxi_zones_data". "taxi_data" and "uber_data" are downloaded directly from https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page through the code. "weather_data" and "taxi_zones_data" are from files downloaded into local storage in folder named "weather", "taxi_zones" respectively, and the 2 folders are stored into a folder called "data" within the same directory as the project notebook code.

In Visualization 6, the heatmap is created into "heatmap_2020.html" which is not shown by running the code. A screenshot of the heatmap is put in a markdown cell to show the result instead.
